README for rzh (Receive Zmodem Here)


LICENSE

	MIT


INSTALLATION

	$ make
	$ make test       (requires that some form of sz be installed)
	$ make install


USAGE

	See the man page.  If you've installed the program, "man rzh" should
	work.  If not, run the following command in the source directory.

		$ make rzh.1 && nroff -man rzh.1 | less


NOTE

	It's rather difficult for rzh to determine where the zmodem tranfer
	ends and the user's command prompt begins.

	It *could& parse the stream looking for a ZFIN packet followed by the 
	ender's final over-and-out.  When it sees that, it would disconnect
	the receive process and send all further data (presumably the command
	prompt after the sz process exits) to the user's terminal.
	
	This sort of in-band control is typically pretty evil [1].  Instead
	of watching the transfer, I've chosen to have this program send a "\n"
	when it reconnects the user's terminal to the remote system.  The
	first command prompt is lost, but the "\n" causes another one to be
	printed so the user should be none the wiser.

	The issue is, of course, is if your shell interprets CRs as actions
	(GDB would be one example).  I don't know of any real-world shells
	that do this.


[1] I am reminded of catting hayes command strings to the ttys of random
    modem pool users back in the early 90s.  This would kick them off
	immediately and free up some lines for friends trying to get on.
	In-band control almost always leads to problems and major security
	issues.
