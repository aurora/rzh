rzh -- Receive Zmodem Here
Scott Bronson


USAGE

Simply run this command in the directory where you'd like to receive
files.

$ cd ~/downloads
$ rzh

Then, whenever you see a file that you'd like to appear in your
downloads directory, simply run sz on it.

$ ssh my.asplode.com
$ sz /etc/hosts

After a little transfer time, the /etc/hosts file on my.asplode.com
appears in ~/downloads.  Couldn't be easier.
