README for rzh (Receive Zmodem Here)

LICENSE

- The code that I wrote is MIT licensed.  This is unrestricted, like public
  domain, but removes liability from its author.
- The pdpzm code is in the public domain.
- The bgio.c file *might* sport an ancient BSD license.  I've rewritten most
  of it so it probably doesn't apply anyore.  And, given the turmoil of the
  90s (Lion Book, etc), it may be in the public domain now.  Hard to say.
- The executable is either MIT or BSD licensed, depending on the previous item.


INSTALLATION

	$ make
	$ make test       (requires that some form of sz be installed)
	$ make install


USAGE

See the man page.  If you've installed the program, "man rzh" should
work.  If not, run the following command in the source directory.

	$ make rzh.1 && nroff -man rzh.1 | less
