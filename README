README for rzh (Receive Zmodem Here)


LICENSE

	MIT


REQUIREMENTS

	Your system must have a /usr/bin/rz program that rzh can call.
	Though the code is atrocious, I can recommend lrzsz.  To run
	the test suite ("make test"), you'll need an sz command as well.


INSTALLATION

	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install


USAGE

	See the man page.  If you've installed the program, "man rzh" should
	work.  If not, run the following command in the source directory.

		$ make rzh.1 && nroff -man rzh.1 | less

	Very basic:

		$ rzh /tmp
		Saving to /tmp on localhost.
		$ rzh -i
		rzh is downloading to /tmp
		$ sz myfile
		100 bytes transferred in 0.0 seconds.
		$ exit
		rzh exited.
