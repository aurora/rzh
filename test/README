running bittertest on a ramdisk
-------------------------------

To save wear and tear on your hard drive, it's a good idea to
run bittertest on a ramdisk.  This assumes you're using kernel 2.6
and you have enough ram to hold the file being transferred.
bittertest uses up to 64 MB, plus filesystem overhead.
Change bittertest's maximum file size by setting the MAXSIZE parameter.


# mkdir /tmp/ram
# chown bronson /tmp/ram    (the user that's going to run bittertest)
# mount -t ramfs ramfs /tmp/ram
$ ./bittertest -t /tmp/ram


What's /dev/shm?  Could this be used instead of ramfs?
