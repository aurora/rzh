running bittertest on a ramdisk
-------------------------------

To save wear and tear on your hard drive, it's a good idea to
run bittertest on a ramdisk.  This assumes you're using kernel 2.6
and you have enough ram to hold the files being transferred.
bittertest creates files up to 64 MB, so you need 128 MB plus
filesystem overhead.  Change bittertest's maximum file size by
setting MAXSIZE.

# mkdir /tmp/ram
# chown USER /tmp/ram    (the user that's going to run bittertest)
# mount -t ramfs ramfs /tmp/ram
$ ./bittertest -t /tmp/ram
