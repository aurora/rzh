Running bittertest on a ramdisk
-------------------------------

To save wear and tear on your hard drive, it's a good idea to
run bittertest on a ramdisk.  This assumes you're using kernel 2.6
and you have enough ram to hold the files being transferred.
bittertest creates files up to 64 MB, so you need well over 128 MB
of physical memory.  Change bittertest's maximum file size by
setting MAXSIZE.

# mkdir /tmp/ram
# chown USER /tmp/ram    (the user that's going to run bittertest)
# mount -t ramfs ramfs /tmp/ram
$ ./bittertest -t /tmp/ram


License Note
------------

mt19937ar.c has a somewhat oddball license (it's like bsd+attribution?).
This would be a showstopper if I tried to include the code from mt19937ar.c
directly in the rzh utility.  However, because it's only a part of a
utility in the test suite and will probably never be distributed in binary
form, I think that I'm completey within compliance.

So, if you distribute the randfile utility in binary form, well, you'll have
to to add a lot of idiotic legalese to your documentation.
