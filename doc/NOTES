ZDLE: escape char.  I think it's ^X (CAN).
	ZDLEE to send a ZDLE char

ZPAD: *, begins frames

CAN: ^X.  5 CANs abort the transfer.

	* ZDLE A TYPE F3 F2 F1 F0 CRC1 CRC2
	* ZDLE C TYPE F3 F2 F1 F0 CRC1 CRC2 CRC3 CRC4

Back channel, receiver sends hex headers:

	* * ZDLE ZHEX TYPE F3-F0 CRC1 CRC2 CR LF XON
		(except no xon in ZFIN)

ZDLE: ^X	ZHEX: B		TYPE: ZFIN=08	CRC=0000	\r\n^Q


Priority: prevent zmodem garbage from being sent to the master
	and screwing up the user's terminal session.

Read from 4: master -> child, sender -> receiver

	Watch for zfin.  If zfin is found, suppress following "OO"
	if they are sent (yes this means that if the user's prompt
	begins with a raw OO it will be suppressed.  Tough.  Again
	Chuck is an idiot for making these typable, printable characters.
	He should have used ^C^C or something)

	So, when we see a ZFIN from the sender, this means that he is DONE.
	We will not send any more zmodem data to him except for perhaps a
	ZFIN packet from the reciever.

Read from 7: child -> master, receiver -> sender, backchannel

	"**\030B0800000000022d\015\212" is a ZFIN packet.
	Receiver will never send OO
