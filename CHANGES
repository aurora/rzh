KNOWN BUGS:
- Can't cancel transfer without rzh hanging indefinitely.


20 Apr 2006:
* Branch 0.8 just before the big scary refactoring.

20 Mar 2006:
* Finally got the last of the known transfer bugs.  It now works pretty well!
* Bump version to 0.8.

17 Jun 2005:
 * It works!  It finally sometimes works.

13 Jun 2005:
 * Try forking a new rz process to handle the zmodem transfer.
   pdpzm works but it has some boundary case bugs and is excruciatingly slow.

13 Nov 2004: tagged version 0.2 (r27)
 * Made zmfr.c modular, sent in patches.
 * Added send functionality but it appears very broken.

05 Nov 2004: tagged version 0.1 (r21)
 * Switched to the pdpzm library because the lrzsz code is amazingly brittle.

15 Jan 2004:
 * First version.  Tried to modify lrzsz's rz command to add this feature.
