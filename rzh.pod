=head1 NAME

B<rzh> - Receive ZMODEM Here

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To transfer the /etc/hosts file
on tt.asplode.com (which is only reachable via www.asplode.com),
to the current directory:

  $ rzh
  $ ssh www.asplode.com
  $ ssh tt.asplode.com
  $ sz /etc/hosts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rzh sits in the background listening for a zmodem transfer request.
When it sees one, it springs to action and sucks down the file.
It can also be useful for copying files between directories on the
local machine.  Simply run rzh in the destination directory, then cd
to the source directory and use sz to copy the files.

When you're done transferring files, you can use ^D or "exit" to stop rzh.

=head1 OPTIONS

Specify the directory that you'd like to receive files to on the
command line.  If no directory is supplied, the current directory
is used.

=item B<-q>

Suppresses the printing of status messages.
Error messages are still printed to stderr.

=item B<-r>

Receives a file immediately into the current directory.
Effectively the same as the L<rz(1)> command.

=item B<-t>

Specifies the timeout for zmodem transfers in seconds.
Accepts fractions (i.e. a timeout of 1/2 second would be
"-t 0.5").

=item B<-v>

Increases verbosity.

=item B<-V>

Prints the version and exits.

=head1 NOTES

If rzh is running as root, it will not mark downloaded files as executable
or special.  0666 is the most permissive permission allowed.  If running
as a regular user, of course, it preserves as much of the permissions
as it can.

To ensure that we don't mess up other character encodings,
we do not attempt to sanitize the filename.  This is a feature.
I'll fix this if somebody can show that's it's a security hazard.

We don't support directories in the filename.  If the sending program
includes directories (i.e. "a/b/file.ext"), we'll fail to create the file.

rzh launches whatever shell is specified in the SHELL environment variable.
If it's not specified, it tries to launch _PATH_BSHELL as specified at build
time on the local machine (this is typically "/bin/sh").
