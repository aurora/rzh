=head1 NAME

B<rzh> - Receive ZMODEM Here

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rzh> [B<-q>|B<-v>] [I<directory>]

To transfer the /etc/hosts file on tt.asplode.com to the current directory.

  $ rzh
  $ ssh www.asplode.com
  $ sz /etc/hosts
  173 bytes sent in 0.3 seconds.
  $

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rzh forks itself ot the background and handles zmodem transfer requests.

rzh can be useful for copying files between directories on the
local machine.  Run rzh in the destination directory, then cd
to the source directory and send each file using sz.  This is
easier than specifying the full path every time.

=head1 OPTIONS

In the absence of B<-r> or B<-s>, rzh will fork itself to the background
and wait for a zmodem send request.

Specify the directory that you'd like to receive files to on the
command line.  If no directory is supplied, the current directory
is used.
