pdzm doesn't support the ZXSPARS sparse file operation flag.
	Or the ZTLZW/ZTCRYPT/ZTRLE flags
	Or ZMCLOB (clobber existing file)
	Or ZMPROT (protect existing file)
	Or ZMAPND (append to existing file)
	Or a bunch of other flags.

In getFileData(), we copy the filename using strncpy.
	Problem is, we never actually null-terminate the filename itself.
	Is this OK?  It appears to be...
