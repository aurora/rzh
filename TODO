FIRST: get some goddamn functional tests.  And some unit tests if at
all possible.  But why bother writing unit tests when the units are
all rotten?

- Move logio into the log library.  Need a way for non-fifo parts of
  the code to log buffer contents.  Clean up logio in zrq.c.
- It's ridiculous to have the fds and pids in the task spec.
  Get rid of them, then make all the task specs static.  Those are
  the classes.  Then, pass the fds and pids to task_install to
  create the instances.
  This will get rid of the duplicate closes.
